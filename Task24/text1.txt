Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a kind old woman. Every day, she would feed the birds and tend to her beautiful garden. The villagers loved her, for she always had a warm smile and kind words to share.

One day, as she was watering her flowers, a small bird landed on her shoulder. It chirped joyfully and seemed to understand her love for nature. From that day on, the woman and the bird became the best of friends, sharing stories and enjoying the beauty of their surroundings together.
